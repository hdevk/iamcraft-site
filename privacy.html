<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Effective Date: February 19, 2026</p>

<p>Iamcraft ("we," "our," or "us") operates the following mobile applications: <strong>Core 1</strong> and <strong>A Moment of Stillness (정적의 시간)</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our apps.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We do not collect any personal data. All data is stored locally on your device using the device's built-in storage. No data is transmitted to our servers or any third party.</p>
<p>Core 1 stores: habit data, check-in records, tree names, and settings.</p>
<p>A Moment of Stillness stores: breathing pattern settings, completed session dates, and reminder times.</p>
<p>We do not collect: names, email addresses, location data, health information, photos, contacts, or any other personal information.</p>

<h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
<p>All data is stored exclusively on your device. We do not operate servers that store user data. If you delete an app, all locally stored data for that app will be permanently deleted.</p>

<h2>3. Notifications</h2>
<p>A Moment of Stillness may send local notifications to remind you of scheduled breathing sessions. These notifications are processed entirely on your device. No push notification server is involved, and no data is transmitted.</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We do not use analytics tools, advertising networks, or any third-party services that collect user data. Payments are processed exclusively through the Apple App Store, and we do not have access to your payment information.</p>

<h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Our apps are intended for users aged 4 and older. Since our apps do not collect any personal information, no special data processing occurs for any age group.</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
<p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your data at all times. You can delete all data by uninstalling the app.</p>

<h2>7. International Users</h2>
<p>Our apps store all data locally on your device regardless of your location. No data crosses international borders as no data is transmitted from your device. This policy complies with GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), and PIPA (Korea) requirements through its data minimization approach.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" above.</p>
